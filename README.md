# webpack

At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it recursively builds a dependency graph that includes every module your application needs, then packages all of those modules into one or more bundles.

npm install --save-dev webpack@2.1.0-beta.25
