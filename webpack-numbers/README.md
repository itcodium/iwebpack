# Authoring Libraries

Let's assume that you are writing a small library ,webpack-numbers, that allows users to convert the numbers 1 through 5 from their numeric representation to a textual one and vice-versa, e.g. 2 to 'two'.

The basic project structure may look like this:

project

+  |- webpack.config.js
+  |- package.json
+  |- /src
+    |- index.js
+    |- ref.json
